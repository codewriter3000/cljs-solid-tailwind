# Welcome to the club
Some of us are crazy people. I am one of them. According to the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 1.36% of web
developers use Solid.JS and another 1.26% of developers use Clojure. But this is ClojureScript, which is an even smaller
percentage. So the probability that you'll find another person who uses Solid.JS and ClojureScript is less than 0.017%.
If you're part of that 0.017%, look no further.

## Credits

I put together 2 environments to create this. You can find them here:
- https://github.com/roman01la/solid-cljs
- https://github.com/jacekschae/shadow-cljs-tailwindcss

## Installation
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/codewriter3000/cljs-solid-tailwind.git`
2. Run `yarn add solid-js --save-dev`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. If you're planning on going into production, make a `.env` file in the root directory and set `NODE_ENV="production"`
