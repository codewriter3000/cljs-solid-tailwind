Some of us are crazy people. I am one of them. According to the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 1.36% of web
developers use Solid.JS and another 1.26% of developers use Clojure. But this is ClojureScript, which is an even smaller
percentage. So the probability that you'll find another person who uses Solid.JS and ClojureScript is less than 0.017%.
If you're part of that 0.017%, look no further.
